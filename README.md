This project was a weekend well spent. Built with NextJS and now running on a frozen JSON archive (no database required). Available at http://dalledle.com!


## Getting Started
1) Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/alexbckr/dalledle`
2) Run `cd dalledle` to navigate to the folder
3) Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages

## Developing
1) Run `yarn dev` to start the development server, probably at localhost:3000
2) Edit `data/images.json` to manage frozen archive entries
